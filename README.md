# printf

The standard prototype of printf function in C.
`int printf(const char *format, ...);`
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given).
